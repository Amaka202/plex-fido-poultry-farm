              <div><p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br> <br>
                <strong>• Diseases/Treatment: </strong> <br> <br>
                <strong>– Avian Influenza: </strong> Prevent direct or indirect contact with domestic or wild waterfowl (such as geese or ducks) and their droppings. Avoid high-risk practices such as visiting live bird markets and bird auctions. <br> <br>
                <strong>– Newcastle Disease: </strong> There is no treatment for Newcastle Disease, although treatment with antibiotics to control secondary infections may assist. The virus can remain alive in manure for up to 2 months and in dead carcasses for up to 12 months, however it is easily killed by disinfectants, fumigants and direct sunlight. Prevention relies on good quarantine and biosecurity procedures and vaccination.<br> <br>
                <strong>– Infectious Laryngotracheitis: </strong>There are no specific treatments for the disease but antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infections may reduce losses. Vaccination is available using attenuated live vaccines but this approach perpetuates the disease. |Call a Vertinary Doc|<br> <br>
                <strong>– Infectious Bronchitis: </strong>Only supportive care can be provided once the flock is ill. For prevention, keep a closed flock, away from other poultry. Clean up and disinfect of the coop. Vaccines are also available.<br><br>
                <strong>– Mycoplasmosis: </strong>Mycoplasmas are sensitive to several antibiotics, however vaccines for some mycoplasmas are also available. Good biosecurity procedures are critical for prevention. Mycoplasmas are destroyed by disinfectants and sunlight.<br><br>
                <strong>– Colibacillosis: </strong>Therapeutic success can sometimes be achieved with tetracycline<br><br>
                <strong>– Fowl Cholera: </strong>Fowl cholera can be treated with sulfonamides and antibiotics.<br><br>
                <strong>– Ammonia:</strong> Maintaining litter, having good ventilation and avoiding excess moisture will be a better management strategy than using a product. Ammonia has to be constantly monitored and managed – there isn’t a one and done solution.<br><br>

              <div>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br> <br>
                <strong>– Marek’s Disease: </strong>There is no treatment for MD. Vaccination is the central strategy for the prevention and control of MD. While vaccination will prevent clinical disease and reduce shedding of infective virus it will not prevent infection.<br> <br>
                <strong>– Encephalomyelitis:</strong> Encephalomyelitis is often treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, to which it appears to be responsive. One common protocol is 20-30 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone (maximum dose of 1 g/d) for 3-5 days. Improvement may be observed within hours but usually requires several days<br> <br>
                <strong>– Aspergillosis:</strong> These drugs are the standard treatment for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The most effective treatment is a newer antifungal drug, voriconazole (Vfend). Amphotericin B is another option. All antifungal drugs can have serious side effects, including kidney and liver damage<br> <br>
                <strong>– Botulism: </strong> The main treatment for botulism includes antibiotics, an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing.<br> <br>
                <strong>– Bacterial encephalitis:</strong> If encephalitis is caused by a bacterial infection, it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. Treatment for herpes-related encephalitis includes supportive care, as well as intravenous antiviral therapy with a drug such as acyclovir<br> <br>

              <div>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br> <br>
                <strong>– Rickets (Ca/P/Vit. D3 deficiency or imbalance): </strong>Rickets caused through the presence of dietary mycotoxins can be treated by replacing the toxin-contaminated feed and by supplementing vitamin D3 to three or fourfold of the usual levels.<br> <br>
                <strong>– Synovitis: </strong>Stock should be obtained from M synoviae-free sources and raised with good biosecurity. Antibiotics in feed may help reduce synovitis but are not effective in established cases.<br> <br>
                <strong>– Injury: </strong>Thoroughly cleaned the wound with water, hydrogen peroxide or Vetericyn Plus Poultry Care spray. For especially deep or very dirty wounds, I use a syringe filled with freshly mixed Dakin's solution to flush and irrigate especially deep or very dirty wounds. Keep the wound clean and dry while the bird recovers.<br> <br>

              <div>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br> <br>
                  <strong>– Lice: </strong>The most common treatment for poultry lice and mites for small flock owners is the use of a dust powder or spray solution. Permethrin and tetrachlorvinphos are insecticides commonly used for treating poultry with ectoparasites.<br> <br>
                  <strong>– Mites: </strong>Immediately treat your chickens with a safe insecticide - try diatomaceous earth, absorbacide or Pestene. A couple of days later, treat the chickens again - this will get any remaining eggs and mites. If none of these insecticides work, contact your vet who may be able to prescribe you another poultry dust.<br> <br>
                  <strong>– Pantothenic acid deficiency: </strong>Provide pantothenic acid supplements or feed sources.<br> <br>
                  <strong>– Gangrenous dermatitis: </strong>Total cleanout and disinfection of affected houses has reduced or eliminated gangrenous dermatitis infection on farms with historical problems. Salting of floors has also reduced bacterial challenge in subsequent flocks.<br> <br>

              <div>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br> <br>
                  <strong>– Coccidiosis: </strong>treatment for coccidiosis is Amprolium, which blocks the parasite's ability to uptake and multiply.<br> <br>
                  <strong>– Necrotic enteritis: </strong>Treatment for necrotic enteritis is most commonly administered in the drinking water, with bacitracin (200–400 mg/gal. for 5–7 days), penicillin (1,500,000 u/gal. for 5 days), and lincomycin (64 mg/gal. for 7 days) most often used<br> <br>
                  <strong>– Infectious Bursal Disease: </strong>There is no treatment for IBD but support therapies such as vitamin and electrolyte supplements and antibiotics to treat any secondary bacterial infections, may reduce the impact of the disease.<br> <br>
